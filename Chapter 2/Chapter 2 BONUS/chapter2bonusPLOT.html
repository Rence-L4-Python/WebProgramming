                In the heart of Europe lies Bohemia, a region rich in culture, silver, and stretches of castles. With the death of its beloved ruler, 
                Emperor Charles IV, the kingdom has fallen into disarray. War, corruption, and discord now plague this once-beautiful jewel of the 
                Holy Roman Empire.

                Wenceslas, one of Charles' sons, became the new ruler after inheriting the crown. However, unlike his father, he is naive, self-indulgent, 
                and unambitious. His half-brother, Sigismund, the King of Hungary, senses this as an opportunity to exploit Wenceslas' weakness. Pretending 
                to be friendly, Sigismund visits Bohemia and kidnaps his half-brother. With the king gone, Sigismund is free to pillage Bohemia and take 
                its riches for himself.

                Amid this chaos, you play as Henry, the son of a blacksmith. Your peaceful life is brutally shattered when a group of merciless mercenaries, 
                under the direct orders of King Sigismund himself, ruthlessly burn your village to the ground. Through a bittersweet stroke of fate, you 
                manage to be one of the few survivors of this massacre.
