                        An experienced financial advisor in large-scale mergers and acquisitions, Martin's experience has proven invaluable to the studio. 
                        As one of the few people who originated outside the video game industry, Martin is the CEO of one of the largest European railway 
                        carriers with a fleet of 6,000 cars and 150 locomotives. His experience brings the necessary skills in extensive business management 
                        to Warhorse Studios, where he has undergone the challenges and joys of developing games.

                    <li> <!--description using list for bullets-->
                        Martin's passion for gaming led him to publish his version of the RPG Dragon's Lair, making him one of the pioneers of the Czech 
                        gaming industry. In 1997, he founded the ALTAR Interactive game studio, wherein he managed as a producer and studio manager. In 
                        1998, he released the first Czech internationally distributed game, Fish Fillets, and three years later, the RTS Original War. ALTAR 
                        then published a UFO trilogy: Aftermath, Aftershock, and Afterlight. He later worked as a producer at Codemasters on Operation 
                        Flashpoint: Dragon Rising.

                        Beginning as a graphic artist for 2D games on 16-bit computers, Dan was the lead writer for the first two installments of the 
                        world-famous Mafia series. He is currently the creator, director, and lead designer of Kingdom Come Deliverance, and a key visionary 
                        at Warhorse Studios. His dedication to the game has helped overcome numerous obstacles during its development. His signature games 
                        have sold over 8 million copies, which is a testament to his ability to understand what gamers want.
